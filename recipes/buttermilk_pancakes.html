        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
        <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
                <li>3 teaspoons of baking powder</li>
                <li>3/4 teaspoon of salt</li>
                <li>3 cups of buttermilk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of milk</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.</li>
                <li>Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.</li>
                <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
                <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
